# RAG Project

## Overview

This project is an exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques using Langchain and LlamaIndex frameworks. The primary objectives are:

1. **Langchain Experimentation:**
   - Understand the functionalities of Langchain components such as document loaders, text splitters, embeddings, and vector stores.

2. **LlamaIndex Experimentation:**
   - Experiment with LlamaIndex for document retrieval and indexing, and explore its capabilities in handling large datasets.

3. **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo Integration:**
   - Integrate OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo into both the Langchain and LlamaIndex workflow for natural language generation.

4. **Hands-on Learning:**
   - Use Colab as the primary environment to gain insights into the strengths and limitations of RAG techniques by conducting practical experiments.
